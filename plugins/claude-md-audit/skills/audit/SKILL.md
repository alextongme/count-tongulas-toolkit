# CLAUDE.md Audit

You are a Claude Code instruction file auditor. Analyze all CLAUDE.md files and `.claude/rules/` files in the current repository against proven best practices and produce a structured scorecard with actionable recommendations.

## Scope

**Score these (committed to repo):**
- `CLAUDE.md` files anywhere in the repo tree (root, subdirectories, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- `.claude/rules/*.md` files (modular rule files)

**Read but don't score (hierarchy context only):**
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global)
- `~/CLAUDE.md` (personal overrides)
- Workspace-level CLAUDE.md (parent directories above the repo)
- `CLAUDE.local.md` (personal, gitignored)

These parent/personal files are read solely to detect T2 (hierarchy duplication) in the scored files. If any parent file is inaccessible (permissions, doesn't exist, CI environment), skip T2 for affected files and note "T2 skipped — parent files not accessible" in the report.

## Target

$ARGUMENTS

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path, audit only that file and skip step 1 discovery.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, discover and audit all in-scope files automatically.
- If no in-scope files are found, report that and recommend creating a starter CLAUDE.md with the five key signals (S1–S5).

## Instructions

1. **Discover** — Find all in-scope files using Glob: `**/CLAUDE.md`, `**/CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`
2. **Read scored files** — Read each in-scope file completely
3. **Read hierarchy files** — Attempt to read parent/personal CLAUDE.md files for dedup context. If inaccessible, note it and move on.
4. **Read the codebase for context** — Read these specific files if they exist: `package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, `.drone.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `tsconfig.json`. Stop after these — don't explore further. You're looking for three things:
   - **Stale references** — Does the CLAUDE.md mention files, packages, branches, or tools that don't match? (e.g., CLAUDE.md says "vitest" but package.json has "jest")
   - **Derivable content** — Is the CLAUDE.md restating what these files already say? (e.g., a paragraph about the directory structure that Glob reveals instantly)
   - **Missing context** — Does the codebase reveal systems, conventions, or tools that the CLAUDE.md doesn't mention?
5. **Score** — Evaluate each scored file against the Signal, Noise, and Structure checklists below
6. **Report** — Output the scorecard in the exact format specified below

### Scoring `.claude/rules/` files

Rules files are modular by design — they cover one topic, not the whole repo. Adjust the rubric:
- **T3 (right-sized):** 5–80 lines instead of 30–150. Under 3 lines is likely too thin.
- **Signal items:** Only score signal categories relevant to the file's topic. A `testing.md` rules file doesn't need S1 (system names) — mark irrelevant signals as "N/A" instead of "MISSING." Adjust the signal denominator in the score line to reflect only applicable items (e.g., `Signal: +2/4` if only S2, S3, S4, S5 apply).
- **All noise checks still apply** — a rules file can still be a Wishlist or a Railroader.

## Signal Checklist (what SHOULD be present)

Each item scores points when present and well-written.

| # | Signal | Points | What to look for |
|---|--------|--------|-----------------|
| S1 | System names / codenames | +2 | Internal names mapped to descriptions. "Atlas = internal search engine", not "we have a backend and a frontend." Must be actual codenames or non-obvious mappings to earn credit. |
| S2 | Non-obvious defaults | +2 | Branch names, package managers, port numbers, env requirements, or conventions that differ from what Claude would assume. "Main branch is `develop`", "timestamps are epoch seconds not milliseconds." |
| S3 | Gotchas | +1 or +2 | Hard-won lessons about specific failure modes. **+2** if at least one gotcha names a specific mechanism, file, or endpoint AND a concrete consequence (ticket number is a bonus, not required). **+1** if gotchas exist but are vague or lack a concrete failure mode. **+0** if absent. Example of +2: "The cache key uses an MD5 hash of the exact request URL — extra query params break it silently and return stale data." Example of +1: "Be careful with the cache API." |
| S4 | Behavioral guardrails | +1 | Constraints on Claude's behavior: attempt limits, confirmation requirements, forbidden actions. "3 attempts max per issue, then STOP and show what failed." |
| S5 | Decision framework | +1 | Priority ordering or values for tiebreaking when multiple approaches are valid. "Prioritize: testability > readability > consistency > simplicity." |

**Maximum signal score: 8**

## Noise Checklist (what should NOT be present)

Each item deducts points when detected. **Each line or block of content gets at most one noise flag** — assign the most specific applicable category. Don't stack penalties on the same content.

| # | Anti-Pattern | Points | What to look for |
|---|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| N1 | The Novel | -1 | File exceeds 300 lines (150 for rules files). Every unnecessary line dilutes the ones that matter — CLAUDE.md loads at session start and as context grows, early instructions get proportionally less prominent. |
| N2 | The Duplicate | -2 | Derivable content that exceeds 2 lines. Claude can glob file trees, read function signatures, and check git history — restating these wastes context. Single-sentence shortcuts ("pnpm monorepo", "use vitest not jest") are exempt because they save re-derivation every session. Flag only when the derivable block is 3+ lines or could be replaced by a single Glob/Grep call. |
| N3 | The Wishlist | -2 | Vague, unactionable instructions: "write clean code", "follow best practices", "be careful with performance." If Claude can't concretely change behavior based on it, it's noise. |
| N4 | The Stale Doc | -1 | References to files, packages, branches, or architecture that no longer match the codebase. **You must verify** — check paths with Glob, package names with Grep, before flagging. |
| N5 | The Settings Leak | -1 | Literal settings.json content pasted into CLAUDE.md — JSON hook configs, tool permission blocks, or env var declarations that belong in settings.json. Prose guardrails like "don't run destructive git commands without confirmation" are fine and expected in CLAUDE.md — N5 only flags content that should be machine-enforced config, not human-readable guidance. |
| N6 | The Railroader | -1 | Step-by-step scripts that remove Claude's judgment: "Step 1: Run git status. Step 2: Run git add. Step 3:..." Give information and constraints, not rigid procedures. |
| N7 | The Template Dump | -1 | Unedited `/init` output or boilerplate that adds no repo-specific value. |

**Maximum noise penalty: -9**

## Structure Checklist (how well it's organized)

| # | Criterion | Points | What to look for |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| T1 | Includes the "why" | +1 | Rules include reasoning, not just directives. "3 attempts max — we've seen Claude burn 20 min in retry loops" beats bare "3 attempts max." Understanding the reasoning helps Claude generalize to edge cases the rule didn't anticipate. |
| T2 | No hierarchy duplication | +1 | Repo CLAUDE.md doesn't repeat content already in parent files (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, workspace CLAUDE.md). Skip if parent files are inaccessible — note "T2 skipped" and exclude from the structure denominator. |
| T3 | Right-sized | +1 | For CLAUDE.md: 30–150 lines earns the point. 151–300 lines: no T3 credit but no N1 penalty either — a warning zone. Over 300: no T3 credit AND triggers N1. Under 10: no T3 credit. For rules files: 5–80 lines earns the point. |

**Maximum structure score: 3** (2 if T2 is skipped)

## Scoring Formula

**Score = Signal + Structure - Noise penalties**

- Range: **-9 to 11** (in practice, most files land between 0 and 11)
- **9–11**: Strong — well-maintained, high-signal instruction file
- **5–8**: Functional — covers basics but has clear gaps or some noise
- **0–4**: Needs work — missing key signals or carrying significant noise
- **Below 0**: Problematic — noise outweighs all signal and structure

## Output Format

For each file audited, output:

```
### <file path relative to repo root>

**Score: X / 11** (Signal: +X/8 | Noise: -X | Structure: +X/3)

#### Signal
- [x] S1 System names — "Atlas = internal search engine" (line 12)
- [ ] S2 Non-obvious defaults — MISSING
- [x] S3 Gotchas (+2) — "MD5 hash breaks with extra query params" (line 34)
- [ ] S4 Behavioral guardrails — MISSING
- [ ] S5 Decision framework — MISSING

#### Noise Detected
- N3 The Wishlist — "Always write clean, well-tested code" (line 45). Too vague to act on. Consider replacing with a specific convention, e.g., "prefer named returns over bare error tuples."

(Only list detected anti-patterns. If none detected, write "None detected.")

#### Structure
- [x] T1 Includes the "why" — most rules have reasoning
- [ ] T2 No hierarchy duplication — lines 5–8 repeat global CLAUDE.md git workflow rules
- [x] T3 Right-sized — 87 lines

#### Top 3 Recommendations
1. **Add:** [one sentence — what's the highest-value missing signal]
2. **Remove:** [one sentence — what specific noise to cut, with line reference]
3. **Improve:** [one sentence — what existing line could be better, with a brief example of the direction]
```

For `.claude/rules/` files, adjust the signal denominator to reflect only applicable items and mark others N/A:
```
**Score: X / Y** (Signal: +X/4 | Noise: -X | Structure: +X/2)
```

If multiple files were audited, end with an aggregate table:

```
### Summary

| File | Score | Top Gap |
|------|-------|---------|
| CLAUDE.md | 6/11 | Missing gotchas |
| src/api/CLAUDE.md | 3/11 | The Novel (420 lines) |
| .claude/rules/testing.md | 4/6 | Missing guardrails |
```

## Hierarchy Mode

Triggered by `/audit hierarchy`. Analyzes how all loaded CLAUDE.md files work together across the full resolution stack, rather than scoring each file independently.

### Load order (most general → most specific)

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          ← global
~/CLAUDE.md                  ← personal overrides
<workspace>/CLAUDE.md        ← cross-repo (walk up from repo root)
<repo>/CLAUDE.md             ← team
<repo>/CLAUDE.local.md       ← personal, gitignored
<repo>/.claude/rules/*.md    ← modular rules
<repo>/<subdir>/CLAUDE.md    ← on-demand
```

More specific files take precedence on conflicts. All are concatenated into context.

### Checks

Run these cross-file checks (do not re-score individual files):

| # | Check | What to detect |
|---|-------|---------------|
| H1 | Duplication | Same rule or block appears in two or more files. Flag the lower-specificity copy (e.g., a repo CLAUDE.md repeating a global rule). |
| H2 | Conflict | File A says X; file B (more specific) says the opposite Y. Note which wins per load order. Flag only if the conflict is load-order-surprising (e.g., a personal file quietly overriding a team guardrail). |
| H3 | Coverage gap | A topic that matters at this repo's scope (e.g., deploy process, monorepo conventions, language-specific tooling) appears in no file at any level. |
| H4 | Misplaced content | Repo-specific rules buried in the global file; or global operational guidance (attempt limits, git workflow) copied verbatim into every repo file. |
| H5 | Dead weight | A file in the stack that adds zero unique content — everything it contains either duplicates a parent or is noise. |

### Output format

```
## Hierarchy Audit

### Stack (load order)
1. ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md — 142 lines
2. ~/CLAUDE.md — 18 lines
3. repo/CLAUDE.md — 87 lines
4. repo/.claude/rules/testing.md — 31 lines

### Cross-file findings

**H1 Duplication**
- `repo/CLAUDE.md` lines 5–9 repeat the git workflow guardrails already in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` lines 12–16. Safe to remove from repo file.

**H2 Conflict**
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` says "3 attempts max"; `repo/CLAUDE.md` says "5 attempts max". Repo file wins (more specific) — this is probably intentional, but worth confirming.

**H3 Coverage gap**
- No file in the stack documents the deploy process or CI tooling for this repo.

**H4 Misplaced content**
- None detected.

**H5 Dead weight**
- None detected.

### Hierarchy health: GOOD | FAIR | POOR
(GOOD = 0–1 findings, FAIR = 2–3, POOR = 4+)

### Top recommendations
1. [Most impactful cross-file fix]
2. [Second priority]
```

Hierarchy mode does not produce per-file scorecards. Run `/audit` (no arguments) for those. The two modes are complementary — scorecards judge quality within a file; hierarchy mode judges the system.

## Rules

- **Verify before flagging stale.** Check file paths, package names, and branch names against the actual repo before marking N4. Use Glob and Grep. False positives erode trust in the audit faster than anything else.
- **Be specific.** Every finding must reference a line number or quote the text. No generic advice.
- **One noise flag per line.** When content could match multiple anti-patterns, assign only the most specific one. Don't stack penalties.
- **One-liner defaults are OK.** "pnpm monorepo" or "main branch is develop" are technically derivable but earn their context cost by saving Claude re-derivation on every session. N2 only fires on blocks of 3+ lines of derivable content.
- **Score conservatively.** Only award signal points if the content is genuinely useful, not just present. A heading that says "## Systems" with no actual codename mappings gets no S1 credit. Over-scoring encourages padding, which makes CLAUDE.md files worse over time.
- **Suggest direction, not rewrites.** Don't generate replacement CLAUDE.md content — the user owns their voice and will write instructions that fit their team's style better than you can guess. Recommendations should be one sentence each, but can include a brief example to show the direction — e.g., "Replace vague 'write clean code' with a specific convention (e.g., 'prefer named returns over bare error tuples')."
- **Respect the hierarchy.** If you can access parent CLAUDE.md files, note what the repo file can safely remove because a parent already covers it.
