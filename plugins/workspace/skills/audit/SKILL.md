# Workspace Audit

> From [Count Tongula's Toolkit](https://alextong.me/toolkit) by [Alex Tong](https://alextong.me) — more at [alextong.me/newsletter](https://alextong.me/newsletter)

Reconcile what the workspace *claims* (in `repos.json` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`) against what *is* (repos on GitHub, files on disk, relative mtimes). Produce a classified findings report so the user knows what to fix, what's merely stale, and what's intentional.

**Scope:** cross-repo workspace documents only. Individual repo `CLAUDE.md` files are out of scope — use `claude-brain:audit` for those.

## Preconditions

The current directory (or `$ARGUMENTS` if provided) must be a workspace root — that is, it must contain **both** `repos.json` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. If either is missing:

- If `repos.json` is missing, stop: "Not a workspace root (no `repos.json`). Run `/count-tongulas-workspace:create` first."
- If `.claude/CLAUDE.md` is missing, stop: "Workspace is missing `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Re-run create, or write one."

Also check prerequisites:

    Bash: command -v gh
    Bash: command -v jq
    Bash: gh auth status 2>&1

If any fail, stop and report what's missing. The audit needs `gh` to verify repos and `jq` to read `repos.json`.

## Classification

Every finding must be classified as one of:

- **BUG** — something is broken or demonstrably wrong. `repos.json` lists a repo that 404s on GitHub. CLAUDE.md references a repo not in `repos.json`. A placeholder like `__TEAM_NAME__` is still in the file. The user should fix these before anything else.
- **DRIFT** — the docs are stale but nothing is broken. Contract source file newer than CLAUDE.md. A repo's default branch changed. CLAUDE.md's "Last reviewed" date is more than 90 days old. Worth updating soon.
- **FUTURE** — the file contains an intentional TODO, a `> **TODO:**` block, or a section that's deliberately empty (e.g., "Gotchas" with a placeholder line). Not a defect — the scaffold invites the user to fill these in over time. Report but don't alarm.

When a finding could be BUG or DRIFT, prefer BUG only if you can point to something concretely broken (404, wrong reference, unresolved placeholder). When in doubt, DRIFT.

## Instructions

Run these phases in order. Parallelize within a phase where possible.

### Phase 1: Load the workspace

Read the two authoritative files. Both are required.

- **Read** `{workspace}/repos.json`
- **Read** `{workspace}/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Also capture:

    Bash: stat -f %m {workspace}/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || stat -c %Y {workspace}/.claude/CLAUDE.md

Store as `claude_md_mtime` (epoch seconds).

Parse `repos.json` into a flat list of repos with fields: `name`, `repo` (org/name), `description`, `language`, `defaultBranch`, `tags`, optional `ref`. Build two name sets:

- `registry_full`: every `repo` value (e.g., `acme/payments-api`)
- `registry_short`: every `name` value (e.g., `payments-api`)

### Phase 2: Verify each repo on GitHub

For every repo in the registry, in parallel (batch in groups of 15 if more than 15 repos):

    Bash: gh repo view {org/repo} --json name,defaultBranchRef,isArchived,visibility 2>&1

For each result, record:

- **BUG** if the command fails with "not found", "Could not resolve", or a 404 — the repo is gone, was renamed, or the workspace never had access.
- **BUG** if `isArchived: true` and the user's CLAUDE.md doesn't acknowledge it (search for the word "archived" near the repo name). Archived repos can still be read but cannot be pushed to — downstream automation will break silently.
- **DRIFT** if `defaultBranchRef.name` no longer matches `repos.json`'s `defaultBranch` field. Updating `repos.json` is a one-line fix.
- **DRIFT** if `visibility` is "PRIVATE" but the user's README implies the workspace is public (skip this check if no README.md exists).

Surface non-404 errors (rate-limited, auth, network) as a separate line — do NOT classify these as BUG. Print: "Could not verify {repo}: {error}." and continue.

### Phase 3: Check local clone presence

Use **Glob** to list top-level directories in the workspace. For each repo in the registry:

- If the directory exists and contains `.git`: OK.
- If the directory does not exist: **FUTURE** — noted as "not yet cloned" (running `make setup` will fix it). Do not flag as BUG.
- If the directory exists but has no `.git`: **BUG** — something created the directory without cloning. Likely user error.

Also enumerate directories that exist but are NOT in the registry. For each:

- Skip hidden dirs (`.git`, `.claude`, `.contract-sources`, anything starting with `.`).
- Skip `node_modules`, `vendor`, `__pycache__`, and other common artifact dirs.
- What's left that looks like a repo (contains `.git`) is a **DRIFT** finding: "untracked local clone `{name}` — either add to `repos.json` or delete."

### Phase 4: Cross-check CLAUDE.md against the registry

Search the full CLAUDE.md content for references to repo names. Use these patterns:

- Inline code backticks: `` `repo-name` ``
- Inside tables: `| repo-name |` or cells containing `repo-name`
- Headings and prose: bare word matches for names in `registry_short`

For every mention of a name that looks like a repo (long enough, hyphenated, or matches the project naming convention):

- If it's in `registry_short`: OK.
- If it's NOT in `registry_short` and not obviously a library/tool/system codename: **BUG** — "`{name}` referenced in CLAUDE.md but not in `repos.json`. Did you rename or remove it?" Include the line number.

Also scan for **unresolved placeholders**: any remaining `__SOMETHING__` pattern (double-underscore, uppercase, double-underscore). These are scaffold tokens that should have been replaced:

- `__TEAM_NAME__`, `__TODAY__`, `__TRACKER_PREFIX__`, `__CROSS_REPO__`, `__TRACKER_SECTION__`, `__DEPLOY_TABLE__` → **BUG**. The create skill should have substituted these; their presence means the scaffold was edited by hand or the substitution failed.

### Phase 5: Check the "Last reviewed" date

Grep CLAUDE.md for a line matching `Last reviewed:` followed by a date. If present and older than 90 days relative to today's date: **DRIFT**. The workspace CLAUDE.md template sets this on creation; a stale date is a weak but useful signal that nobody has revisited the file. If absent, skip silently — not every workspace uses this convention.

### Phase 6: Check contract freshness

Look for `.contract-sources` at the workspace root.

- If it doesn't exist: skip silently. The file is optional.
- If it exists: read each path (one per line, ignore blank lines and lines starting with `#`). For each:
  - If the file doesn't exist: **DRIFT** — "contract `{path}` listed in `.contract-sources` but the file is missing."
  - If the file's mtime > `claude_md_mtime`: **DRIFT** — "`{path}` modified after CLAUDE.md was last updated — review Cross-Repo Relationships."

Use a single Bash call with `jq`-style reading or a plain loop; don't spawn one Bash per path.

### Phase 7: Check TODO density

Count lines containing `TODO` in CLAUDE.md. These are **FUTURE** findings — the scaffold intentionally includes TODO markers as prompts for the user to fill in.

- 0–3 TODOs: healthy.
- 4–10: normal for a new workspace; summarize as "FUTURE: {N} unfilled scaffold prompts remain."
- 11+: noteworthy — the workspace may have been scaffolded but never filled in. One-line summary only, do not list each line.

Do NOT flag TODO-laden sections as BUG or DRIFT.

## Output Format

Print results grouped by classification, most urgent first. Skip empty sections. If everything passes, print the "all clean" message under **Output when everything passes**.

```
## Workspace Audit — {workspace_name}

_Audited against GitHub and local state on {today's date}._

### 🔴 BUG — Fix these
- [{category}] {finding}, {file:line if applicable}
- [{category}] {finding}

### 🟡 DRIFT — Stale but not broken
- [{category}] {finding}
- [{category}] {finding}

### 🔵 FUTURE — Intentional TODOs
- {N} unfilled scaffold prompts in CLAUDE.md
- {N} repos in registry not yet cloned

### Summary
{count} BUG, {count} DRIFT, {count} FUTURE. {one-line recommendation}.
```

**Category** is one of: `registry`, `repo`, `clone`, `cross-ref`, `placeholder`, `contracts`, `review-date`. Use these consistently so findings can be grouped.

**Recommendation** is a single sentence. For BUG > 0, suggest fixing the first BUG. Otherwise, pick the most impactful DRIFT. Otherwise, say "healthy — no action needed."

### Output when everything passes

If no BUGs, no DRIFTs, and only FUTURE findings exist (or no findings at all), print the happy-path summary:

```
## Workspace Audit — {workspace_name}

✅ No drift detected. {N} repos verified against GitHub, CLAUDE.md references resolve, contract files are fresh.

{If FUTURE count > 0}: {N} scaffold TODOs remain — these are intentional prompts, not defects.
```

## Rules

- **Don't suggest edits to CLAUDE.md content.** This skill identifies drift; the user fixes it. Do not generate replacement sections or guess at what the user meant. Scope here is strictly verification, not authorship.
- **Don't re-score the file.** For quality scoring, point the user at `claude-brain:audit`. This skill and that one are complementary — drift is orthogonal to quality.
- **Verify before flagging.** A "repo not found" must come from an actual `gh repo view` failure, not a guess. A stale contract must come from an actual mtime comparison. Never flag something you didn't verify.
- **Attribute findings to file and line where possible.** `CLAUDE.md:47` beats "somewhere in CLAUDE.md". Grep returns line numbers — use them.
- **Tolerate non-404 `gh` errors.** Auth failures, rate limits, and transient network errors are not BUGs — they mean the audit was incomplete. Report them as a separate "could not verify" list and continue.
- **Never modify files.** This is a read-only skill. `allowed-tools` excludes Write and Edit by design.
