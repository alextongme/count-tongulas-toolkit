# These validate the structural contract of each plugin — JSON schema,
# gold-spec SKILL.md sections, and deterministic reference files. Full
# behavioral testing of a skill would require running Claude against
# fixtures, which is not feasible in CI; the bet is that if every plugin
# follows the same structural contract, the behavioral bar is met.
